# Cross Sectional Child Income Statistics by College Tier and Parent Income Percentile
### Authors: Vincent Wilmet, Marinie Tao, Alia Haiji

Drawing on the data collected by [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/data/), a research lab at Harvard 
led by the famous economist [Raj Chetty](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=PhDDPiUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate),
we aim to visualize the _full_ landscape of education (in)equalities. 

The data is derived by a mix of Obama's [College Scorecard (2015)](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/) and de-identified 
public data from 1996-2014 American [income tax returns (W-2 Forms)](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-2). 
The *70+ million* children<->parent pairs were drawn between 1978-1991 if they are claimed as dependents by the parent tax 
filers in the U.S, cross referenced and validated with proof of enrollment via the [1098-T forms](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1098-t)
submitted to the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by a student/their university.

Here we can see that having a strong education, like an Ivy Plus education, creates a large proportion of high income earners.
Now lets see if the same translates to their children. 

If the parents went to a strong school, what is the income of their children?
